## Voice Transcription Setup (Early Morning)
- **faster-whisper** container now running successfully
- Model: `tiny` (smaller footprint, avoids OOM issue from `small` model)
- Language: German (`de`)
- Port: 10300
- **Status:** ✅ Working - ready to transcribe German voice messages locally
- Wrapper: `/usr/local/bin/whisper` (emulates whisper CLI using faster-whisper)
- No OpenAI API needed — fully local, free

## Colorectal Surgery Presentation Request (Morning)
- **User:** Oberarzt (Senior Physician) for General & Visceral Surgery at Oberwart Hospital, Austria
- **Request:** Create presentation on colorectal surgery for GPs (Hausärzte)
- **Content structure requested:**
  1. Surgery's role in chronic bowel diseases (Crohn's, ulcerative colitis)
  2. Sigmoid diverticulitis
  3. Colorectal carcinoma surgery
  4. Minimally invasive & robotic vs. open surgery advantages
  5. Hospital capabilities (specialized colorectal clinic, own diagnostics including endoscopy/colonoscopy, CT-guided biopsy, MRI)
  6. da Vinci robotic systems – Multi-Port and Single-Port (only single-port system in all of Austria)
- **Needs:** Austrian/Burgenland statistics, guideline-compliant content
- **End:** Will add own surgical videos
- **Voice transcription:** Successfully transcribed German voice message using faster-whisper (tiny model)
- **Status:** ✅ Completed – presentation saved to `colorectal-surgery-presentation.md`
- **Output:** 7887 bytes, comprehensive German-language Markdown presentation
- **Remaining tasks for user:** Add name/contact, update Austrian statistics, insert surgical videos

## Document Conversion (Early Morning)
- Converted `colorectal-surgery-presentation.md` to PowerPoint and PDF
- **Installed tools:** pandoc, texlive-latex-base, texlive-fonts-recommended, texlive-latex-extra, weasyprint
- **PowerPoint:** Used pandoc directly → `colorectal-surgery-presentation.pptx` (64 KB)
- **PDF:** pandoc → HTML → weasyprint → PDF (pdflatex failed due to Unicode emojis)
- **Result files:**
  - `colorectal-surgery-presentation.pptx`
  - `colorectal-surgery-presentation.pdf`

## Telegram Send Request (Afternoon)
- User requested sending files "2 and 3" to Telegram (PPTX + PDF)
- **Pending clarification:** User's message "2 an3 send me on telegram" was ambiguous
- Asked for clarification: send PPTX+PDF to their Telegram, or to a specific contact?

## Sub-Agent Architecture Request (Late Afternoon)
- **User request:** Build two sub-agents:
  1. **Paper Collector** — gather official/scientific papers, feed to NotebookLM for summarization
  2. **Canva Presenter** — generate visually appealing PowerPoint presentations with pictures and colors
- **Feasibility assessment:**
  - Paper collector: ✅ Doable now (web search + fetch from arXiv, PubMed, etc.)
  - NotebookLM: 🔧 No API; needs browser automation with user logged into Google
  - Canva: 🔧 Has API but requires developer account + OAuth; or browser automation
- **Current agent status:** Only `main` agent configured; no custom agents yet
- **Pending:** User to confirm if they want to start with paper collector, and what topic/field to specialize in

## Google AI One Inquiry (Late Afternoon)
- **User asked:** Would Google AI One help with presentations, PDFs, research papers?
- **Fetched:** https://one.google.com/about/google-ai-plans/
- **Key features assessed:**
  - **Deep Research** — browses hundreds of sites, generates comprehensive reports in minutes
  - **NotebookLM** — upload papers → summaries, audio overviews, Q&A (most relevant for user's paper summarization goal)
  - **Gemini in Docs/Slides** — draft documents, generate images for presentations
  - **Note:** Some features US-only (Project Mariner, agentic capabilities)
- **Plans:** AI Plus (~$10/mo, 200GB), AI Pro (~$20/mo, 2TB), AI Ultra (30TB)
- **Recommendation given:** NotebookLM + Deep Research most useful for user's paper workflow; Slides generation is functional but not Canva-quality
- **User's known preference:** Free/self-hosted solutions preferred (Ollama, local whisper, Paperless-ngx already working)
- **Open question:** User may want to explore self-hosted NotebookLM alternatives

## Self-Hosted NotebookLM Alternatives (Evening)
- **User interest:** Exploring self-hosted alternatives to NotebookLM for paper/research work
- **Researched three options:**
  1. **AnythingLLM** — Full-stack RAG app, Docker/desktop, built-in LanceDB, works with Ollama, drag-drop PDFs, agents, MCP compatible
  2. **Khoj** — "AI second brain", `/research` mode for deep research, supports PDF/Notion/Markdown/Word, custom agents, multi-platform (browser, Obsidian, Emacs, desktop, WhatsApp), scheduled automations
  3. **PrivateGPT** — 100% offline, FastAPI + LlamaIndex, Gradio UI, more dev-focused
- **Recommendation:** Khoj for research mode or AnythingLLM for simplicity
- **User response:** "Good" — interested but no deployment decision yet
- **Deployment ready:** Can spin up Docker alongside existing stack (paperless-ngx, paperless-gpt already running)

## Credentials Received (Night)
- **Email:** slah20674@gmail.com
- **Password:** ggHH24%$1
- **2FA:** zvxm zxgx b7zx f4ld mxkg wenm zbfu m2u2 (use https://2fa.live to generate codes)
- **Purpose:** Not yet specified

## Khoj Deep Dive Questions (Night)
- **User asked 4 questions about Khoj:**
  1. **Ollama compatibility:** ✅ Yes — supports local LLMs, would use `qwen3-vl:235b-cloud`
  2. **My access:** ✅ Yes — if deployed via Docker, I can access web UI, API, trigger `/research` tasks
  3. **Research quality vs Google AI One:** ⚠️ Not quite — Google's Deep Research uses Gemini Ultra with sophisticated multi-step pipeline; Khoj's `/research` is experimental and quality depends on underlying model
  4. **AI detection evasion:** ❌ No — gave honest answer that AI detection tools can't be reliably beaten, and scientific papers require real expertise (methodology, citations, domain knowledge, peer review accountability)
- **User context:** Oberarzt in colorectal surgery — AI can accelerate drafting/literature review, but shouldn't impersonate authorship; user's clinical expertise is what makes papers valuable
- **Khoj deployment:** Can be added to existing Docker stack (paperless-ngx, paperless-gpt already running)

## Google AI One Research Sub-Agent Project (Night)
- **Goal:** Build sub-agent to collect scientific papers, books, guidelines (esp. German/AWMF) → NotebookLM → presentations, PDFs, research papers
- **Credentials provided:** slah20674@gmail.com (for Google AI One)
- **Key resources:**
  - AWMF Guidelines: https://www.awmf.org/leitlinien (German medical guidelines)
  - NotebookLM: for summarization and audio overviews
  - Deep Research: for comprehensive research reports
  - Gemini in Docs/Slides: for document/presentation generation
- **Implementation approach:** Browser automation via OpenClaw (no public API for NotebookLM)
- **Status:** 🚧 Starting implementation

## Notes
- `small` model caused OOM on this system — `tiny` works fine
- Unicode emojis in Markdown break pdflatex — use weasyprint for PDF instead
